# Tetris-Game (Reflection & LINQ)

This branch contains a modified version of the Tetris Game which uses a few more advanced features.  
It uses deconstruction for swapping and LINQ to make the code a bit shorter.  
Additionally, the Block array in BlockQueue is populated using Reflection.  

Thanks to Raz Megrelidze for this contribution!
